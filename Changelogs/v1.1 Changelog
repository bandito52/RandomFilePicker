###  v1.1 - September 19, 2023 ###

  --  Changes  --  
1. Changed variable name Found to Result
2. Found a massive time saver fix. Under Roller variable, removed "/a-d" after %directory%.
		 The directory was being checked very ineffeciently.
	   Removing this cut the already-short time in half. So now getting a new file is near instantanious!
		 Time cut from 1.5-5 seconds to about 0.3-0.5 seconds!

3. Start variable no longer gets jumped back every time the user presses ENTER.
		 Added a redirect to step 3 so user does not get sent back to Step 1 AND deal with a directory refresh.

  --  Additions  --  
1. Added an interactive choice screen on whether you want to delete the file.
		Press ENTER to skip.
		DEL to permanently delete file.
		VIEW lets you see the same file again.
  	REFRESH lets you refresh the entire pool of files, if you added new files.

2. Added new functions to callback to based on choices.
     Roller, this quickly grabs a new file in the established directory, instead of rechecking the entire directory over and over.
		 Review, this lets the user jump back to viewing the file again.

3. Added step numbers to let the user know where the process is at, and what it is doing.
4. Added CLS at various steps so the screen would remain clean and clear.
5. Added new line that grabs the file size, and displays it with each result. No impact to sequential file grabs.
