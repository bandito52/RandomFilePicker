### 1.4 - April 4, 2024 ###

v1.4 corrects a lot of redundancy, brings in new features, and improves flow.

--  Additions  --
1. Can now open:
	Files with spaces in the name
	Gifs
	Photos that are super small such as 64x64 pixels. 

2. Can now create your own keybinds! Simply edit the file in a text editor or Notepad.
	The keybinds are at the top of the file. Each key or phrase must have a space between them.
	Ex: "bind_delete=1 test bob d del sally sue"
	Special characters are heavily limited by design. Recommend only a-z 0-9 characters.

3. Can now set color of personal choice in the config section



--  Changes  --
1. All text color is now in Aqua. You can also change this at the top of the file.

2. The Options Choice page now displays the keybinds.

3. Removed the following:
	 Redundant list of characters to check for auto skip(Fixed in v1.3.1)
	 Redundant check for ENTER in line75. Pressing ENTER automatically proceeds...
	 Some line spacing for looks.
	 Details at the beginning (No one actually cares during use.)
    File size message. Unnecessary and did not look clean.

4. Renamed some steps and binds for better clarity:
	Step Names:
		Roller is now Randomizer
	Keybinds:
		view is now review
		refresh is now reload
		Keybind documentation will provide pre-v1.4 and v1.4+ binds.



--  Fixes  --
1. Delete bug was found and squashed. Have tested even more key options to ensure stability.
	This fix will be pushed into previous versions.
  Reorganized a few things so accidental deletions are no longer possible.
