### 1.4.2 - June 18, 2024 ###

v1.4.2 adds a manual mode, and a filter to prevent accidents such as other scripts/executables/keywords.

--  Additions  --
1. Manual Mode:
	Disabled by default.
	Allows you to manually set your search mode each time you run the script. 

2. Filters:
	Can filter out extensions such as ".exe", or ".py"

	.exe is filtered by Default



--  Changes  --
1. Code Optimization
	Cleaned up some redundancy and added simpler checks



--  Fixes  --
6. When search criteria is not specific enough, there was a chance for the script to open folders despite being told to only open files with extensions.
