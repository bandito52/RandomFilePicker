	- You will also see what words/phrases you have allowed/blocked.

--  Changes  --
1. Improved Workflow:

	- Search Mode will be checked upon launching so you wont have to wait for the directory and THEN be checked.
	- An additional check has been added to prevent different file types appearing.

2. Terminology:
	- 'bind_review' is now 'bind_open'
	- Step 1 was reworded.
	
3. Miscellaneous:
	- Error Code 400 now shows what incorrect mode you entered.
	- Error Code 403 has been removed. Was unnecessary.


-- Fixes --
1. In some instances, files with other names are being opened despite Allow Filter not specifying them.
2. In some instances, files with other extensions are being opened despite their file-mode not being selected.
*These bugs were due to some files having similar names to other file extensions.

3. Various logic fixes.
