###  v1.4.1 - April 7, 2024  ###
v1.4.1 lets you choose certain file types based on file types or phrases if you want to edit them further.

-- Additions --
   1. Can now set what file types you want to search for.
	       Simply pick between 1-5 in your config.
	       There 5 different criterias.(Images, Videos, Music, All 3, or Every type)
	       There are 4 types of files in each media type. (Check config for more info)

   2. There are now error messages to reflect these additions. (Incorrect Search Number / Search Timeout)

-- Fixes --
   1. Files with spaces in name did not get deleted.
   2. Entering r to reload directory but it instead reviewed.
	Due to Choice menu pulling strings so if choice 1 is review and choice 2 is r then entering r will pull choice 1 since r is part of review.
