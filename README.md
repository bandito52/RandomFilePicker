### Want a simpler version that strictly opens media content? ###
[RandomFilePicker - Vue](https://github.com/bandito52/RandomFilePicker/releases/tag/Vue) has you covered!


### Future Plans ###
Plan to keep optimizing as I have recently gotten back into programming. 
Would like to have this in some form of a GUI and different language that opens files in-window and add quicker key functionality. 


### Credits ###
chinagreenelvis, whoever they may be, started this rabbit hole with sharing his code for what I call v1.0.

While I was searching for a way to randomly open any file in a folder, I found a link to his help-post.
