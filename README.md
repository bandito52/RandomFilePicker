While searching for a way to randomly view files, his post came up through the web. Being fascinated, I decided to enhance it even further.



### Future Plans ###
Plan to keep optimizing as I have recently gotten back into programming. 
Would like to have this in some form of a GUI and different language that opens files in-window and add quicker key functionality.
